# Minishell

## Description

Minishell is a lightweight Unix shell written in C, built as part of the 42 curriculum. The goal is to reproduce the core behavior of `bash --posix`, including command execution, environment variable management, redirections, pipes, and signal handling.

The project covers a wide range of systems programming concepts: process creation with `fork`/`execve`, inter-process communication via pipes, file descriptor manipulation, signal handling with `sigaction`, and terminal control with `termios`. The shell parses and executes command lines through a full pipeline: lexing, syntax checking, expansion, quote removal, parsing, and execution.

### Features

- Interactive prompt with command history (via `readline`)
- Builtins: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`, `$?`)
- Single and double quote handling
- Redirections: `<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<` (heredoc)
- Pipes (`|`) with support for multi-segment pipelines
- Multiple heredocs on the same command (`cat << A << B`)
- Quoted heredoc delimiters disable expansion (`cat << 'EOF'`)
- Signal handling: `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+\` in all contexts (prompt, execution, heredoc)
- Proper exit codes following bash behavior (126, 127, 130...)

## Instructions

### Requirements

- GCC or Clang
- GNU Make
- `readline` library (`libreadline-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)

### Compilation

```bash
make
```

This produces the `minishell` executable at the root of the repository.

```bash
make clean    # remove object files
make fclean   # remove object files and executable
make re       # recompile from scratch
```

### Execution

```bash
./minishell
```

The shell starts in interactive mode. Type commands as you would in bash:

```bash
minishell$ echo "hello world"
hello world
minishell$ cat << EOF | grep hello
> hello world
> bye
> EOF
hello world
minishell$ export FOO=bar && echo $FOO
bar
minishell$ exit
```

To run non-interactively (e.g. from a script):

```bash
echo "ls | grep .c" | ./minishell
```

### AI usage

AI assistance (Claude, Anthropic) was used during the development of this project for the following tasks:

- **Debugging**: identifying the root cause of a double heredoc bug caused by `dup2` being called on `STDIN_FILENO` between heredoc reads, which corrupted the `save_stdin` captured in subsequent `handle_heredoc` calls. The fix was restructuring `apply_redirs` to resolve all file descriptors before applying any `dup2`.
- **Signal and terminal handling**: understanding why `Ctrl+\` printed `^\` during heredoc input despite `SIGQUIT` being set to `SIG_IGN` — the cause being `ECHOCTL` at the tty driver level — and implementing the fix via `tcsetattr`/`VQUIT`/`_POSIX_VDISABLE`.# minis
